# yelp recommendation engine
A project in collaboration with Nicholas Dara Avishan to investigate Yelpâ€™s open dataset with 200k businesses and 1.4 million business attributes and to build a lookalike model in R and Python to extract a pool of target audience from similar businesses that were filtered for preferred location, categories and popularity 

## Dataset
This is a sample engine aiming to test the feasibility of such a recommendation and filtering system. Therefore, only part of the Yelp Dataset was utilized. The dataset can be downloaded at https://www.yelp.com/dataset and you can use the whole dataset of part. Just change the file name in the code.
